Hello! Interestingly, I got introduced to programming in my freshman year at [Tsinghua University, Beijing, China](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), where I graduated in the Top 10% of my class with a Bachelor's Degree. Currently, I'm pursuing Master of Computer degree (2022-2024)  at [National University of Singapore, Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/).

I'm currently working as a developer for **HackerTrail** in the Scout branch. My responsibilty includes TypeScript/Python based on front-end,  microservices development & testing.

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
