I'm a Singapore based software developer with a goal-driven creative mindset and passion for learning and innovating.

Currently working as a Software Developer intern at [HackerTrail](https://www.hackertrail.com/), a leading technology company that specializes in recruitment solutions. My focus at HackerTrail is primarily on their innovative product, [Scout](https://getscout.ai/?utm_source=HTwebsite&utm_medium=navigation+&utm_campaign=scoutproduct).

Outside work, I sketch my thoughts on [Issuu](https://issuu.com/zuoy17/docs/portfolio)!
